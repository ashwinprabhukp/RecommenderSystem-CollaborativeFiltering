Recommender systems are systems that are created to make recommendations to users based on a variety of different criteria. These systems forecast the product that users are most likely to be interested in.

There are different types of Recommender systems. The ones we have used in this project are listed below:

1. <b>Popularity-Based Recommendation System</b>: It's a kind of recommendation system that bases choices on factors like popularity and/or current trends. These algorithms look up the products or movies that are most in demand or well-liked by users and then immediately suggest those.

2. <b>Collaborative Filtering</b>: It is regarded as one of the very clever recommender systems that utilizes user similarity as well as things that are frequently used on e-commerce and online movie websites. It makes recommendations by examining the preferences of comparable users.
